Example diode bridge rectifier

Learned about full-wave diode bridge rectifiers in electronics class today. It's a simple circuit that converts AC power (which changes direction) into DC power (which flows in one direction). The circuit uses four diodes arranged in a square pattern to make this happen. Unlike simpler half-wave rectifiers, this design uses both the positive and negative parts of the AC wave.

In class, we built a test circuit and used an oscilloscope to see how it works. The input showed a regular wave pattern going up and down, while the output showed the same pattern but only above the zero line. This showed how the circuit successfully converted the power from AC to DC.

We added a Zener diode for voltage regulation and a capacitor to smooth out the ripples in the output voltage. These rectifiers are found in many everyday devices like phone chargers and power supplies, where stable DC voltage is needed.
