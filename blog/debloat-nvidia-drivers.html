    <h1>How to debloat your nvidia drivers</h1>
    <p>
      Nvidia drivers are extremely bloated, we can reduce the amount of nvidia
      processes by a lot by correctly reinstalling and debloating the nvidia
      driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure that you have
      <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank">7-zip</a> or
      any other software that can extract files.
    </p>
    <h3>Uninstalling Drivers</h3>
    <p>
      To uninstall your current nvidia drivers we are gonna use a software
      called <strong>Display Driver Uninstaller</strong>, it can be downloaded
      <a
        href="https://www.guru3d.com/download/display-driver-uninstaller-download/"
        target="_blank"
        >here</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have downloaded and extracted it, open it up and in the advanced
      options make sure to tick
      <strong
        >Prevent downloads of drivers from "Windows update" when "Windows"
        search for a driver for a device</strong
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, select your GPU as device type and
      <strong>Clean and do NOT restart</strong> (it is more recommended to
      restart but im lazy you can do it if you want). This will completely
      remove your display driver.
    </p>
    <h3>Debloating and installing drivers</h3>
    <p>
      Once that is done, go to the
      <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx" target="_blank"
        >nvidia advanced driver search</a
      >
      and download the latest nvidia driver for your GPU.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extract the <code>.exe</code> file you downloaded and delete all folders
      <strong>except</strong> <code>NVI2</code> and <code>display.driver</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Open <code>setup.cfg</code> with any text editor and scroll all the way
      down, delete the following lines:
    </p>
    <pre>
        &lt;file name=&quot;${{EulaHtmlFile}}&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;file name=&quot;${{FunctionalConsentFile}}&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;file name=&quot;${{PrivacyPolicyFile}}&quot;/&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>After that you can save the file and run the driver setup as normal.</p>
